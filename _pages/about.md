I am a development economist currently pursuing a [PhD in Economics at Stellenbosch University](https://www.sun.ac.za/english/faculty/economy), where my dissertation focuses on informal sector dynamics, productivity gaps, and survival strategies in Zimbabwe. My doctoral work is supervised by [Eldridge Moses](https://www.ekon.sun.ac.za/staff/moses-eldridge) and [Kholekile Malindi](https://www.ekon.sun.ac.za/staff/malindi-kholekile). I also serve as a Tutor in [International Trade](https://www.ekon.sun.ac.za/undergrad/244) within the Department of Economics. I hold a Master’s and Honours degree in Economics from the [University of Zimbabwe](https://www.uz.ac.zw/) and my master’s dissertation was supervised by [Pheneas Kadenge](https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/social-studies-departments/234-department-of-economics/economics-staff/528-dr-pheneas-kadenge).

I am currently a member of the [Research on Socio-Economic Policy (RESEP)](https://resep.sun.ac.za/) unit at Stellenbosch University, the [Econometric Society](https://www.econometricsociety.org/), and the Zimbabwe Economics Society. My research interests span labour markets, the informal sector, public finance, social protection, and poverty dynamics, with a particular focus on sub-Saharan Africa.

I have extensive experience in research and policy environments. I worked as an Economist at the [Southern African Parliamentary Support Trust (SAPST)](https://www.sapst.org/), conducting socio-economic analysis of public policies, national budgets, and proposed legislation. I served as a Policy Intern on Domestic Resource Mobilisation for the [African Forum and Network on Debt and Development (AFRODAD)](https://www.afrodad.org/), coordinating research and policy analysis and representing the organisation in networks and policy events. I also worked as a Statistician at the [Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (ZIMSTAT)](https://zimstat.co.zw/), where I handled data cleaning, quality control, and survey instrument design. Earlier in my career, I taught economics as a part-time lecturer at the Marondera University of Agriculture Science and Technology and worked as a Teaching and Research Assistant at the University of Zimbabwe.

In addition to my academic work, I provide consultancy and policy advisory services for organisations working on social protection, public finance, and development policy in Southern Africa. Some of my recent consultancy and research projects include parliamentary oversight of loans in SADC countries, budget expenditure analysis on early childhood development, and analysis of psychosocial support funding across six SADC countries. I have collaborated on these projects with [Albert Makochekanwa](https://esami-africa.org/global-faculty-profiles/albert-makochekanwa/), [Chengetai Madziwa-Kanyangu](https://southernafricatrust.org/team/chengetai-madziwa-kanyangu/), [Rangarirai Chikova](https://www.lawyersofafrica.org/about/palu-secretariat/) and [Michael Takudzwa Pasara](https://commerce.nwu.ac.za/economic-and-management-sciences/michael-takudzwa-pasara). 


I am skilled in household survey and administrative data management, visualization and analysis, and applied microeconometrics with cross-sectional and panel data. I am proficient in Stata and R programming as well as qualitative research tools such as NVivo and Atlas.ti.
