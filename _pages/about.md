Hi there! I'm an applied development micro-economist primarily focused on labour markets and policy evaluation in developing countries. I'm currently a Junior Research Fellow at the [Development Policy Research Unit (DPRU)](https://commerce.uct.ac.za/dpru) housed in the School of Economics at the [University of Cape Town](https://uct.ac.za), where I'm also a fourth-year PhD candidate. Here, you will find a depository of my work including publications, working papers, reports, and opinion pieces.

I earned my undergraduate, honours, and masters degrees from [Stellenbosch University](http://www.sun.ac.za/english). My PhD dissertation, under the supervision of [Professor Haroon Bhorat](https://commerce.uct.ac.za/dpru/prof-haroon-bhorat-profile), focuses on estimating and examining the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on labour market inequalities in South Africa. While my work centers around labour economics in the South African and African context, it also considers poverty and inequality measurement and analysis, social protection, the economics of education, and health economics. My expertise lies in household survey and administrative data analysis, micro-econometrics with cross-sectional and panel data, and causal inference. My research has been published or is forthcoming in *Journal for Labour Market Research*, *Development Southern Africa*, and *BMC Public Health*, among other outlets.

In my work for the DPRU, I have done economic advisory work for several organisations including the World Bank, the Brookings Institution, the United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER), the Agence Françeise de Développement (AFD), as well as several departments of the South African government including the Presidency, National Treasury, and the Departments of Employment and Labour, Higher Education and Training, and Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation. Prior to joining the DPRU, I worked as a research assistant for the [Research on Socio-Economic Policy (RESEP) unit](https://resep.sun.ac.za) and a research intern in [South Africa's central bank](https://www.resbank.co.za/en/home).
