Hi there! I'm an applied development micro-economist primarily focused on labour markets and policy evaluation in developing countries. I'm currently a Junior Research Fellow at the [Development Policy Research Unit (DPRU)](https://commerce.uct.ac.za/dpru) housed in the School of Economics at the [University of Cape Town (UCT)](https://uct.ac.za), South Africa. Here, you will find a depository of my work including publications, working papers, reports, and several resources I find useful.

I earned my PhD from UCT in 2024, and am scheduled for graduation in September 2024. Under the supervision of [Prof Haroon Bhorat](https://commerce.uct.ac.za/dpru/prof-haroon-bhorat-profile), my thesis considers the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on labour market inequalities in South Africa. I earned my undergraduate, honours, and masters degrees from [Stellenbosch University](http://www.sun.ac.za/english), with [Prof Ingrid Woolard](https://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/staff/ingrid-woolard/) and [Dr Debra Shepherd](https://resep.sun.ac.za/team-member/debra-shepherd/) serving as my co-supervisors for the latter. My work centers around labour economics in the South African and African context, but also considers poverty and inequality, social protection, the economics of education, and health economics. My expertise lies in household survey and administrative data analysis, micro-econometrics with cross-sectional and panel data, and causal inference. My research has been published or is forthcoming in *Journal for Labour Market Research*, *Energy Economics*, *Journal of Health Communication*, *Development Southern Africa*, and *BMC Public Health* among other outlets.

I have also done economic advisory work for several multilateral organisations including the World Bank, the Brookings Institution, the United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER), and the Agence Françeise de Développement (AFD), as well as several departments of the South African government including the Presidency, National Treasury, the Department of Employment and Labour, and the Department of Higher Education and Training. Prior to joining the DPRU, I worked as a Research Assistant for the [Research on Socio-Economic Policy (RESEP) unit](https://resep.sun.ac.za) and a Research Intern in [South Africa's central bank](https://www.resbank.co.za/en/home).
