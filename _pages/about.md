Hi there! I'm an applied development micro-economist primarily focused on labour economics and policy evaluation in developing countries. I'm currently a Junior Research Fellow at the [Development Policy Research Unit (DPRU)](https://commerce.uct.ac.za/dpru) housed in the School of Economics at the [University of Cape Town](https://uct.ac.za), where I'm also a fourth-year PhD candidate.
